# project-1-wdi - Space Invaders

# Project Description

We had one week to build an in-browser game using HTML, CSS, Javascript & JQuery. I built a version of the retro arcade game Space Invaders.

# Game Description

######The game uses the left and right arrows to move the character along the bottom of the screen within the main box and the spacebar to shoot at incoming alien enemy.

######As your score increases based on the number of enemy killed, the speed of the grid of aliens increases.

The build

I wanted to get the movement of the aliens and the main character working to begin with and build on it from there.

# project-1-wdi - Space Invaders

# Game Description

A remake of the retro arcade game Space Invaders. It uses the left and right arrows to move your character along the bottom of the screen and the spacebar to shoot at incoming alien enemy.

I wanted to get the movement of the aliens and the main character working to begin with and build on it from there.
